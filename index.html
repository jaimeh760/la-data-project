                                Throughout its whole life, this hamster had to endure tribulation from the United Hamster States of Hamerica.
                                All it did was wait for a miracle to happen, but it realized, as the sky shed tears on its life, that miracles were nothing but myths;
                                they were a mere distant future that never got to exist in a world of misery. 
                                It implores everyday for at least a coin, but no one ever seem to care. 
                                So, it became a thief; it snatched a hamster's purse, anticipating it contained fortune, and it ran. 
                                It ran excessively fast like the Flash Hamster from DC Hamsters. 
                                It was so fast that the cops was able to catch up in less than one minute.
                                Yet, this hamster had a heart and returned the purse back to its owner by throwing it at a distance of 3 meters.
                                However, the hamster cops arrested it either way.

                                This hamster was arrested for illegally biting a human. 
                                It all occured when a human stook a finger towards the hamster's face.
                                The hamster asserted that it was aggravated by the dirty nails the human had.
                                So, it took a bite of the finger to convey not to let filth get close by.

                                Commonly known as the Pervert Hamster. 
                                It all began... when this tiny creature had its eyes stuck on a lovely human.
                                The human seem to care less if the hamster was secretly watching her change clothes or not because she assumes the hamster is just a hamster.
                                She was wrong. It's not just a hamster... it's a hamster... PERVERT.  
                                Unfortunately, the hamster was caught by the Hamster Police Department and was arrested for secretly watching a human change for sexual pleasure.
                                After all, that hamster must've had a good time.

                                It has been a darkest night. The moon shines brightly. 
                                Rains fall. Sweat replenishes. Energy sinks. 
                                Trails come by every step of the way. There is no water. It was dying of thirst.
                                With a couple of energy left, it saw what looks like an abandoned Smurf home.
                                And as it steps closer, more homes appear. They look identical.
                                But, which one has the source of hydration? 
                                It was like a game of hide and seek; water is hidden, and the little fellow finds the treasure.
                                The tiny hamster sought for water. One of the homes must have what it desires.
                                As soon as it reaches for the knob, the hamster cops caught it offguard and arrested it for trespassing a home available for any hamster to share and live in like a communist hamster home.
                                Farewell. Farewell, little fellow.

                                The sound they make, makes the hamster poop abruptly. 
                                It thought throwing its feces at it would make the car stop making noise.
                                Sadly, it was caught by the hamster cops, and they arrested it for illegally throwing an object at a toy car that was moving with the wind.

                                The world is corrupted.
                                All are lies.
                                No one can be trusted.
                                There is no such thing as peace.
                                It was until war was the only option to massively reduce the population of this treacherous world.
                                None can support the entire population... of hamsters.
                                None are safe.
                                None will be able to survive what is to come.
                                It will be the survival of the fittest.
                                Only the strong and intelligent will survive.
                                This was all the fault of Rood. 
                                Rood was the ruler of the United Hamster States of Hamerica, and everyone hates it.
                                It must have its crown taken down before this world comes to an end.
                                That is why the Batman hamster took it down and saved this world from evil.

                                It dug up from garbage to garbage, collecting tools, items and antiques to refine them and use them.
                                It found wood, nails, and a hammer.
                                This was all it needed to build its dream business and live a new life.
                                Due to digging up garbage from other hamsters' homes, it was arrested for robbery.

                                It runs around town trying to find which hamster house to steal from.
                                Once it saw the most aesthetic-looking toy car, it broke its window and got in.
                                Vroom. Vroom. Vroom. The car started its engine.
                                The noise can be heard from afar, alarming the HPD.
                                The little hamster drove the car while leaving trails behind.
                                The HPD was at its tail.
                                The hamster drove at an intense velocity of one mile per hour.
                                It was pretty fast for a toy car.
                                With a velocity of two miles per hour, the hamster police were able to surround the car thief and turn it in to prison.
